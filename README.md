##  About Me

✨ I'm a **Computer Science Engineering undergraduate** who enjoys breaking problems down into **simple, beginner-friendly logic**.  
✨ I strongly believe **clarity > complexity** — both in code and explanations.  
✨ I learn best by **doing**, whether it's simulations, algorithms, or system design.

I’ve worked across **DSA, Python, C++, SQL, and simulations**, with a growing interest in **cybersecurity and system modeling**.
