## 🌱 About Me  

I'm a **Computer Science Engineering student** who loves breaking down complex problems into simple, beginner-friendly solutions.  
I believe **clarity > complexity**, both in code and explanations.

I enjoy learning by **building, simulating, and visualizing systems** — especially where **security, networks, and real-world impact** meet.
